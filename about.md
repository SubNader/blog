Hello everyone!

My name is Nader, a data engineer, a former Data Engineer at EyeEm, a former Big Data intern at IBM and a CCE graduate from Alexandria University, where I also did some undergrad research on scalable analytics.

I grew up near the very (read extremely) warm shores of Jeddah before moving to Alexandria for university.

After graduating, I moved to Berlin to take care of the data pipelines at EyeEm.
I then moved to Delivery Hero to join its Global Analytics team. A bit over a year and a half later, I moved internally to work on the customer data platform and services.

I speak English, Arabic and (a little) German.
