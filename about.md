My name is **Nader Elsharkawy**, a data (platform) engineer.

I am currently a Staff Data Engineer at [Delivery Hero](https://deliveryhero.com) and have previously worked at [EyeEm](https://eyeem.com).

Prior to that I was an intern at IBM's Client Innovation Center, as well as an undergraduate researcher at [Alexandria University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_University), where I did some research on scalable analytics.

I grew up near the very (read extremely) warm shores of [Jeddah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah) before moving to [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria) for university.

After graduating, I moved to Berlin to take care of the data platform at EyeEm.

I then moved to Delivery Hero to join its Global Analytics team. A bit over a year and a half later, I moved internally to work on the global customer data platform and services.

I speak English, Arabic and (a little) German.
