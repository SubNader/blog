Hello everyone!

My name is **Nader** and I am a data platform engineer.

I grew up near the very (read extremely) warm shores of [Jeddah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah), moved to [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria) for university, before finally settling in [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin).

I am currently an Engineering Manager at [Delivery Hero](https://deliveryhero.com) and have previously worked at [EyeEm](https://eyeem.com).

Prior to that I was an intern at IBM's Client Innovation Center, as well as an undergraduate researcher at [Alexandria University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_University), where I did some research on scalable analytics.

I speak English, Arabic and (a little) German.

You can find my resume [here](/NaderElsharkawyResume.pdf).
